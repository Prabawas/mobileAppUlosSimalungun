# Real-Time Detection Application for Simalungun Ulos Fabric Using SSD MobileNetV2 FPN

The Real-Time Simalungun Ulos Fabric Detection Application is an application that is expected to serve as a platform for introducing and educating the public, especially the younger generation, about the culture of Simalungun Ulos fabric. This application can directly detect Simalungun Ulos fabric objects and classify them into specific categories. Not only does it classify the fabric, but it also provides detailed explanations about the Ulos Simalungun fabric, including its description, usage instructions, meaning, and additional information. The application was developed by implementing the SSD algorithm model as the decision-making mechanism, MobileNetV2 as the backbone or feature extractor, and FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) to extract the smallest features from the Ulos Simalungun fabric, thereby achieving optimal accuracy in real-time detection.
